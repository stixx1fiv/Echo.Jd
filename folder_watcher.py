    # In a real implementation, this function would contain a loop
    # to monitor the folder_path and put new file paths into file_queue.
    # For the stub, we'll just print a message and return.
    # The thread in run_daemons.py that calls this will then exit,
    # which is fine for a stub as long as it doesn't break other logic.
    # If FileProcessorDaemon relies on files being added to the queue by this watcher,
    # then for testing that part, files would need to be added to the queue manually
    # or this stub would need to be enhanced to add a dummy file.

    # For now, let's keep it simple and not add files to the queue automatically
    # to isolate its functionality. We can test FileProcessorDaemon separately.
